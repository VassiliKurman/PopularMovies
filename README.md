# Popular Movies
Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, I build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. Development of this app is split in two stages.

In this stage I build the core experience of movies app.

This app will:

    Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
    Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
        The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
    Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
        original title
        movie poster image thumbnail
        A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
        user rating (called vote_average in the api)
        release date
